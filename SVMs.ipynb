    "Finally, we are going to look at one other type of linear regression model: Ridge regression. OLS has a fundamental flaw, which is that it can _overfit_ to the training data. This means that aspects of the data which are in fact noise can become built into the prediction, causing errors when making new predictions that have different noise.\n",

    "The regularisation term is on the right. This forces the model to minimize not just the prediction error, but also the size of the weights. But why do we want this? You may be familiar with the concept of Occam's razor. This principle says that whenever you have more than one possible explanation for a phenomenon, you should prefer the simplest explanation. Regularization enables us to encode this principle mathematically - a simpler explanation, even one that is technically worse on the training data, is preferred over a more complex solution which may be making too many assumptions. This helps us to _generalize_ to unseen data, by making as few assumptions as possible from our training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\lambda$ here dictates how important the regularisation term is to the cost function. Set it to zero, and the regularizer is ignored - our weights can be as big as the model could possibly dream of. Set it _too_ high, however, and the model will care more about keeping the weights small than it will about getting good performance. A healthy balance is required, and differs between different problems. \n",
