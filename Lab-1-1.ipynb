The topics that will be covered in this lab include:\n",

    "* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)\n",
    "* Nearest neighbors classification algorithm\n",
    "* Nested cross-validation\n",

    "### Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular way to mitigate this overfitting issue is to train your model on *some* of the data (the training set) and validate your model on the remaining data (the validation set). You will then select the model/configuration that performs best on the validation data. The train/validate division of the data is usually done with a 70%/30% split. Often, practitioners will use a third data set, the test set (or hold-out set), to get a sense for how their best model performs on unseen, real-world data. In this scenario, you will tune your models to perform best on the validation set and then test their \"real-world\" performance on the unseen test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes applications don't have enough data to do these splits meaningfully (e.g., the test data is only a few samples). In these cases, *cross-validation* is a useful technique (and, indeed, has become standard in machine learning practice). \n",
    "\n",
    "The general premise of \"k-folds\" cross validation is to first divide the entire dataset (grey) into a training set (green) and a test set (unseen data, blue). Then, we divide the training set into different folds and use these folds to form new sub-training and sub-test sets. We select the model configuration that performs the best on all of these. The below figure provides a nice visualization for what's going on here:\n",
